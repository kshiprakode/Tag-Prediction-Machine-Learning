At the same time, other sorting algorithms are studied which are $O(n \log n)$ in the worst case (like &lt;strong&gt;mergesort&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;heapsort&lt;/strong&gt;), and even linear time in the best case (like &lt;strong&gt;bubblesort&lt;/strong&gt;) but with some additional needs of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a quick glance at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_of_algorithms&quot;&gt;some more running times&lt;/a&gt; it is natural to say that quicksort &lt;strong&gt;should not&lt;/strong&gt; be as efficient as others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, consider that students learn in basic programming courses that recursion is not really good in general because it could use too much memory, etc. Therefore (and even though this is not a real argument), this gives the idea that quicksort might not be really good because it is a recursive algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why, then, does quicksort outperform other sorting algorithms in practice?&lt;/strong&gt; Does it have to do with the structure of &lt;em&gt;real-world data&lt;/em&gt;? Does it have to do with the way memory works in computers? I know that some memories are way faster than others, but I don't know if that's the real reason for this counter-intuitive performance (when compared to theoretical estimates).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:&lt;/strong&gt; a canonical answer is saying that the constants involved in the $O(n\log n)$ of the average case are smaller than the constants involved in other $O(n\log n)$ algorithms. However, I have yet to see a proper justification of this, with precise calculations instead of intuitive ideas only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, it seems like the real difference occurs, as some answers suggest, at memory level, where implementations take advantage of the internal structure of computers, using, for example, that cache memory is faster than RAM. The discussion is already interesting, but I'd still like to see more detail with respect to memory-management, since it appears that &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answer has to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several web pages offering a comparison of sorting algorithms, some fancier than others (most notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/&quot;&gt;sorting-algorithms.com&lt;/a&gt;).

So when a running process blocks on I/O, assuming that the process uses the normal system APIs, other processes will be allowed to run until the I/O is complete, and eventually the original process will resume once the I/O is done.

In the context of the linux kernel, executing some IO system call such as &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt; will cause a &lt;code&gt;sysenter&lt;/code&gt; or interrupt handler to trigger to look after that IO, calling &lt;code&gt;do_sys_read()&lt;/code&gt; ultimately. Here, if the current request cannot immediately be satisfied, the function calls &lt;code&gt;sched()&lt;/code&gt; which then may execute another process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the context of a co-operative system, I would expect that when you make a system call for some IO reason, if the request cannot be satisfied the kernel picks another task and executes that. &lt;a href=&quot;http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/share/os/cpu-scheduling.pdf&quot;&gt;This document&lt;/a&gt; provides some background - basically, if you waited on IO, you could be hung forever waiting for that IO.
